# Foundations_of_ML

- This repository contains my answers to the coding homework assignments provided in the course **DS-GA 1003, Machine Learning and Computational Statistics**, available via Bloomberg ML EDU (https://bloomberg.github.io/foml/#home)
- Each subdfolder contains my answer code in a .ipynb file, as well as the homework text (pdf file), and any starter code and data provided in the course.  
  
## Aim of the course:
Gain a deep understanding of the concepts, techniques and mathematical frameworks used by experts in machine learning. 

## Topics covered: (-- in progress! --)
  
- Gradient descent
- Stochastic gradient descent
- Ridge regression
